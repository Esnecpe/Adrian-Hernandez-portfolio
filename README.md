## 🚀 About Me

I’m a motivated Computer Science student with a strong foundation in data science, software development, algorithms, operating systems, and cybersecurity. I enjoy building practical, efficient solutions while deeply understanding how systems work under the hood — from low-level concepts to full applications.

Alongside my academic background, I bring real-world experience that sharpened my communication, problem-solving, and teamwork skills. I’m highly adaptable, detail-oriented, and comfortable working in fast-paced, collaborative environments.

I’m currently seeking **internship or entry-level opportunities** where I can grow as an engineer and contribute to impactful, real-world projects.
